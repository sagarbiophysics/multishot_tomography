Multishot Tomography using SerialEM script commands (old)
==========

Following workflow describes Multishot data acquisition as depicted in Fig. 3 of `Multishot Tomography preprint <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.10.487763v1>`_

    Fig 1. Multishot tilt series acquisition provides high throughput way to sub-nanometer *in situ* subtomogram average from FIB-milled lamellae. 


We want to achieve following goals: 

- Setup custom pattern for Multishot acquisition.
- Modify SerialEM dose-symmetric acquisition script for Multishot acquisition.
