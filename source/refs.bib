	abstract = {Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA) can resolve protein complexes at near atomic resolution, and when combined with focused ion beam (FIB) milling, macromolecules can be observed within their native context. Unlike single particle acquisition (SPA), cryo-ET can be slow, which may reduce overall project throughput. We here propose a fast, multi-position tomographic acquisition scheme based on beam-tilt corrected beam-shift imaging along the tilt axis, which yields sub-nanometer in situ STA averages.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
